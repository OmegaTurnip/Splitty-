# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
