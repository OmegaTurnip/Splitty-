Agenda approved
Minutes were generally approved 

Announcements by TA:
Testing feedback was released
Schedule for the presentation was released
	Frank is attending our presentation (will ask difficult questions)
Need to hand in something as a draft for the presentation

Started at 2:45
When the app was presented and TA was generally impressed with certain things.

Questions for TA:


-Maurits: Am I doing too much?
	We can generate reports ourselves (GEIT), the discrepancy is getting out of hand
	Big discrepancy between Lasse and Maurits.
-Paras: Buddycheck feedback, Is it possible to see your submission?
	TA can send the screenshots personally

Talking points:
-Currently bugs halt the progress massively
	Multiple things were tried but nothing solved it yet.
	Issue might possiblibly be the empty constructor or the weak entity mapping
-Things that are currently missing are the admin page and the long-polling/websockets
-Controllers are redundant due to the cascading 
-Switching tasks should be done more often and we should talk (online/in-person) more about the things we are stuck on.
-Milestone next week:
	Main idea: Basiq requirements finished
		Bug needs to be fixed urgently
		Admin page needs to be done
		Take a look over the rubric
	We already started a bit with the extended features
	Websockets and long polling is needed
	Sum all expenses 

Can we check automatically if we have 10 clients connected?
	Good idea to just spawn the application 10 times

	Long polling: To check if someone else already updated the same page you are looking at.
	Websockets: Admin page 

Productive meeting
Additional question to TA:
	Code distribution lines will get deleted from GEIT report when someone else alters/deletes them
