# Get to know each other - Formative Assessment

## 1) Self-organization

Insufficient. The team was not in charge of the meeting. Some people spoke more than others, so please try to have everyone included in the conversations, and if you're on the quieter side, try to engage yourself a bit more. The tone of the conversations was respectful.

## 2) Suggested Topics

Sufficient. All the suggested topics have been covered, but not particularly in-depth. For the upcoming Code of Conduct deadline, refer to the teamwork lecture, and also familiarize yourself with the rest of the course material, available templates, etc.

## Notes

This is feedback for our first meeting, where it wasn't expected from you to take charge, so don't worry too much about the week 1 grade. It's just a guideline for you, to allow you easier planning of future meetings, as a similar rubric will be applied to your future meetings.
