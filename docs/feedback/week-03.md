# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute-taker.

#### Agenda

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The agenda was clear and well-structured, but formatting could use a bit of work - it's a bit hard to distinguish the "formalities" from the central topic of the meeting.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Action points are short and slightly vague, but are otherwise clear and actionable.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair did a good job of keeping the meeting on track and ensuring that all topics were covered.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team was very active and involved in the discussion, and the overall atmosphere was constructive.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application and the application was potentially shippable. There was progress compared to last week and the team is on a good track to create a working application until project end.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The team discussed the action list of last week and goals were mostly reached. The goals that were not reached do not jeopardize team's progress as a whole.
